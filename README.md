### Motivation and a summary of the results of the analysis

I chose to analyze Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey results from 2021 (https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021.zip).
I am a web developer, so I was curious about technology other developers use in the world and some specific countries.

The questions I tried to answer, using this data, are:

1. What programming languages were used the most among all respondents and in different countries?

*JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python and SQL were used the most. JavaScript is the clear leader.  
Although in China Python takes 1st place.*

2. What operating systems were used the most among all respondents and in different countries?

*Windows is by far the leading operating system. Next, Linux-based and MacOS are used by about the same amount of respondents.  
In Russia, Germany and India Linux-based OS is more popular than MacOS.*

3. What highest level of education do respondents have? What about some specific countries?

*Almost half of respondents have Bachelor's degree. Next big group, just a little over 20%, have Master's degree.  
India has by far highest proportion of respondents with Bachelorâ€™s degree.*

4. How well can we predict the age of respondents?

*With just default parameters for the model we could predict the Age with 70.6% accuracy.*

The average, whole world, trends not necessary go the same way, as in specific countries. Sometimes the difference is significant.

More details of the results are shared in my [blog post](https://natashk.github.io/blog/DS/).

### Acknowledgments
The dataset, I used, is published on the Stack Overflow website ([https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)). I used the results from 2021.

In order to make a wordcloud, I used some of the code from [https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/auto_examples/parrot.html](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/auto_examples/parrot.html).
