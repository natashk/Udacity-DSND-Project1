### Motivation and a summary of the results of the analysis

I chose to analyze Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey results from 2021 (https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021.zip).
I am a web developer, so I was curious about technology other developers use in the world and some specific countries.

The questions I tried to answer, using this data, are:

1. What programming languages were used the most among all respondents and in different countries?

*JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python and SQL were used the most. JavaScript is the clear leader.*

2. What operating systems were used the most among all respondents and in different countries?



3. What highest level of education do respondents have? What about some specific countries?



4. How well can we predict the age of respondents?
